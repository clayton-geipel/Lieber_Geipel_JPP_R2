  abstract = {To investigate the accuracy of tomographic particle image velocimetry (Tomo-PIV) for turbulent boundary layer measurements, a series of synthetic image-based simulations and practical experiments are performed on a high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layer at Re$\theta$ = 7,800. Two different approaches to Tomo-PIV are examined using a full-volume slab measurement and a thin-volume ``fat'' light sheet approach. Tomographic reconstruction is performed using both the standard MART technique and the more efficient MLOS-SMART approach, showing a 10-time increase in processing speed. Random and bias errors are quantified under the influence of the near-wall velocity gradient, reconstruction method, ghost particles, seeding density and volume thickness, using synthetic images. Experimental Tomo-PIV results are compared with hot-wire measurements and errors are examined in terms of the measured mean and fluctuating profiles, probability density functions of the fluctuations, distributions of fluctuating divergence through the volume and velocity power spectra. Velocity gradients have a large effect on errors near the wall and also increase the errors associated with ghost particles, which convect at mean velocities through the volume thickness. Tomo-PIV provides accurate experimental measurements at low wave numbers; however, reconstruction introduces high noise levels that reduces the effective spatial resolution. A thinner volume is shown to provide a higher measurement accuracy at the expense of the measurement domain, albeit still at a lower effective spatial resolution than planar and Stereo-PIV.},

  abstract = {A methodology for a posteriori uncertainty quantification of pressure data retrieved from particle image velocimetry (PIV) is proposed. It relies upon the Bayesian framework, where the posterior distribution (probability distribution of the true velocity, given the PIV measurements) is obtained from the prior distribution (prior knowledge of properties of the velocity field, e.g., divergence-free) and the statistical model of PIV measurement uncertainty. Once the posterior covariance matrix of the velocity is known, it is propagated through the discretized Poisson equation for pressure. Numerical assessment of the proposed method on a steady Lamb--Oseen vortex shows excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations, while linear uncertainty propagation underestimates the uncertainty in the pressure by up to 30 {\%}. The method is finally applied to an experimental test case of a turbulent boundary layer in air, obtained using time-resolved tomographic PIV. Simultaneously with the PIV measurements, microphone measurements were carried out at the wall. The pressure reconstructed from the tomographic PIV data is compared to the microphone measurements. Realizing that the uncertainty of the latter is significantly smaller than the PIV-based pressure, this allows us to obtain an estimate for the true error of the former. The comparison between true error and estimated uncertainty demonstrates the accuracy of the uncertainty estimates on the pressure. In addition, enforcing the divergence-free constraint is found to result in a significantly more accurate reconstructed pressure field. The estimated uncertainty confirms this result.},

  abstract  = {Tomographic particle image velocimetry (tomographic-PIV) is a recently developed measurement technique used to acquire volumetric velocity field data in liquid and gaseous flows. The technique relies on line-of-sight reconstruction of the rays between a 3D particle distribution and a multi-camera imaging system. In a turbulent flame, however, index-of-refraction variations resulting from local heat-release may inhibit reconstruction and thereby render the technique infeasible. The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of tomographic-PIV in a turbulent flame. An additional goal was to determine the feasibility of acquiring usable tomographic-PIV measurements in a turbulent flame at multi-kHz acquisition rates with current-generation laser and camera technology. To this end, a setup consisting of four complementary metal oxide semiconductor cameras and a dual-cavity Nd:YAG laser was implemented to test the technique in a lifted turbulent jet flame. While the cameras were capable of kHz-rate image acquisition, the laser operated at a pulse repetition rate of only 10 Hz. However, use of this laser allowed exploration of the required pulse energy and thus power for a kHz-rate system. The imaged region was 29 {\texttimes} 28 {\texttimes} 2.7 mm in size. The tomographic reconstruction of the 3D particle distributions was accomplished using the multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique. The results indicate that volumetric velocimetry via tomographic-PIV is feasible with pulse energies of 25 mJ, which is within the capability of current-generation kHz-rate diode-pumped solid-state lasers.},

CMOS digital cameras are used to detect both planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and particle scattering (in a stereo arrangement) such that a 5 kHz measurement frequency is attained. This diagnostic is demonstrated in lifted-jet and swirl-stabilized flames, wherein the dynamics of the flame stabilization processes are seen. Nonperiodic effects such as local ignition and/or extinction, lift-off and flashback events, and their histories can be captured by this technique. As such, this system has the potential to significantly extend our understanding of nonstationary combustion processes relevant to industrial and technical applications.},

This technique provides simultaneous measurements of temperature, separate O2 temperature, and mole fraction of N2, O2, CO, CO2, and C2H4. The experiments reveal a highly unsteady turbulent flame, approximately two-dimensional in the mean, which propagates downstream from the cavity and towards the observation wall. Measurements in the flame region reveal a flow that is largely divided into reactants (freestream fluid) and (nearly) equilibrium products, separated by flames that cannot be resolved by the CARS measurement volume, which is about 1 mm long. Mean and standard deviation of the resolved fluctuations of the temperature and mole fractions of species are quantified. The peak standard deviation in each profile across the flame occurs where the mean gradient is steepest, and is about 37% the difference between reactants (freestream) and products conditions. Several cases were investigated including limiting combustion cases near the lean fuel and low air temperature blowouts; in all cases the flame propagation angles are the same and distributions of suitably normalized mean and fluctuation parameters are similar at all locations and for all cases.},

A simultaneous measurement of the volumetric velocity field is possible without the need for additional hardware. Droplets which vaporize in the preheat zone of the flame serve as the marker for the flame front. The droplets are illuminated with a laser and imaged from four different views followed by a tomographic reconstruction to obtain the volumetric particle field. Void regions in the reconstructed particle field, which correspond to regions of burnt gas, are detected with a series of image processing steps. The interface separating the void region from regions filled with particles is defined as the flame surface. The velocity field in the unburnt gas is measured using tomographic PIV. The resulting data include the simultaneous 3D flame front and 3D volumetric velocity field at 5 kHz. The technique is applied to a lean-premixed ( ϕ   =  0.8), swirling methane-air flame and validated against simultaneously acquired planar measurements. The mean error associated with the reconstructed 3D flame topography is about 0.4 mm, which is smaller than the flame thickness under the studied conditions. The mean error associated with the volumetric velocity field is about 0.2 m s −1 .},

  abstract = {This paper describes the principles of a novel 3D PIV system based on the illumination, recording and reconstruction of tracer particles within a 3D measurement volume. The technique makes use of several simultaneous views of the illuminated particles and their 3D reconstruction as a light intensity distribution by means of optical tomography. The technique is therefore referred to as tomographic particle image velocimetry (tomographic-PIV). The reconstruction is performed with the MART algorithm, yielding a 3D array of light intensity discretized over voxels. The reconstructed tomogram pair is then analyzed by means of 3D cross-correlation with an iterative multigrid volume deformation technique, returning the three-component velocity vector distribution over the measurement volume. The principles and details of the tomographic algorithm are discussed and a parametric study is carried out by means of a computer-simulated tomographic-PIV procedure. The study focuses on the accuracy of the light intensity field reconstruction process. The simulation also identifies the most important parameters governing the experimental method and the tomographic algorithm parameters, showing their effect on the reconstruction accuracy. A computer simulated experiment of a 3D particle motion field describing a vortex ring demonstrates the capability and potential of the proposed system with four cameras. The capability of the technique in real experimental conditions is assessed with the measurement of the turbulent flow in the near wake of a circular cylinder at Reynolds 2,700.},

The regions of intense dissipation have the tendency to appear in the vicinity of intense vortices. Furthermore, the joint pdf of the two invariants of the reduced velocity gradient tensor exhibits the characteristic teapot-shape. These results, based on a statistical analysis of the data, are in agreement with previous numerical and experimental studies at lower Reynolds number, which validates the suitability of long-range $\mu$PIV for characterizing turbulent flow structures at high Reynolds number.},

  abstract  = {Understanding the mechanisms and physics of flame stabilization and blowoff of premixed flames is critical toward the design of high velocity combustion devices. In the high bulk flow velocity situation typical of practical combustors, the flame anchors in shear layers where the local flow velocities are much lower. Within the shear layer, fluid strain deformation rates are very high and the flame can be subjected to significant stretch levels. The main goal of this work was to characterize the flow and stretch conditions that a premixed flame experiences in a practical combustor geometry and to compare these values to calculated extinction values. High resolution, simultaneous particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar laser induced fluorescence of CH radicals (CH-PLIF) measurements are used to capture the flame edge and near-field stabilization region. When approaching lean limit extinction conditions, we note characteristic changes in the stretch and flow conditions experienced by the flame. Most notably, the flame becomes less critically stretched when fuel/air ratio is decreased. However, at these lean conditions, the flame is subject to higher mean flow velocities at the edge, suggesting less favorable flow conditions are present at the attachment point of the flame as blowoff is approached. These measurements suggest that blowoff of the flame from the shear layer is not directly stretch extinction induced, but rather the result of an imbalance between the speed of the flame edge and local tangential flow velocity.},

The 3D data enable the computation of the nine components of the velocity gradient tensor and other important kinematic quantities. The volumetric PIV is combined with single-shot simultaneous OH PLIF imaging to mark the instantaneous reaction zone at one plane in the reconstructed volume. The combined datasets enable the investigation of the relationship between the reaction zone and the fully-3D representations of strain, vorticity, kinetic energy dissipation and dilatation, and of the impact of heat release on the structure of turbulence. In this Re d = 8000 flame, it is observed that sheet-like layers of vorticity and dissipation tend to coincide and are aligned with the OH layers, an effect that is believed to be due to the stabilizing effect of heat release on this relatively low Reynolds number jet flame. Furthermore, the spatial organization of the strain field is predominantly driven by the presence of the flame rather than turbulence. Finally, intense dissipation is mostly due to the laminar shear caused by the presence of the flame rather than to the strain generated by vortical structures as typically observed in nonreacting jets.},

Until now, it has not been possible to capture large volumes that incorporate the full wavelength of the aerodynamic track left behind during a complete wingbeat cycle. Here, we use a unique apparatus to acquire the first instantaneous wake volume of a flying animal{\textquoteright}s entire wingbeat. We confirm the presence of wake deformation behind desert locusts and quantify the effect of that deformation on estimates of aerodynamic force and the efficiency of lift generation.

  abstract  = {Mass and energy exchange processes near the in-cylinder walls have become increasingly important for internal combustion engine research and development. Heat-transfer and fuel-deposition processes are not well enough understood to fully predict their magnitude and temporal and spatial variation. To a large extent, improvements in modeling are limited because of a lack of experimental guidance on the dynamics of boundary-layer flows in engines. High-speed particle image velocimetry and micro particle image velocimetry were used to study the boundary-layer flow field at the cylinder head of a motored internal combustion engine for three different engine speeds (400, 800 and 1100?r/min). Velocity measurements were taken throughout the compression stroke and the beginning of the expansion stroke, and comparisons to the frequently used law-of-the-wall were made.The low-resolution particle image velocimetry images showed that the average bulk flow maintained a tumble flow throughout the compression and expansion strokes and velocities scaled with engine speed. Adequate spatial resolution of the boundary-layer flow required the use of high-resolution (micro particle image velocimetry) measurements which showed that the log-law does not accurately describe the experimental boundary-layer structure in the outer layer (30<y+<50). Using the log-law, the velocity for earlier crank angles (180?260 crank angle degrees) was over predicted while the velocity for later crank angles (300?330 crank angle degrees) was under predicted, as engine speed increased. However, the experimental velocity profiles near the wall (y+<4) matched the description of the viscous sublayer (u+=y+). Furthermore, it was observed that the thickness of the viscous sublayer decreased as the engine speed increased. The viscous sublayer could not be adequately resolved at 1100?r/min because of the limitations in adequate seeding density near the surface and the resulting loss of data points closest to the wall.The capability of high-speed particle image velocimetry measurements is demonstrated by the ability to identify and track vortical structures that move through the outer and buffer layers. Future work must address the evolution of such flow structures, along with measurements of temperature, to enable development and validation of boundary-layer models that are not restricted by the assumptions necessary for the law-of-the-wall such as steady bulk flow conditions and properties.},

  title =    {Aerodynamics of a Scramjet Cavity Flameholder at On- and Off-Design Conditions},
  school =   {Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Virginia},
  year =     {2017},
  abstract = {Supersonic combustion ramjet (scramjet) engines offer the promise of making hypersonic aircraft an operational reality, lowering the costs of space access and enabling a responsive high-speed flight capability for national defense. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is a technique ideal for the aerodynamic characterization of the scramjet flameholding process due to its ability to provide instantaneous and ensemble measurements at high spatial resolution across a planar measurement region. This work applied PIV to two configurations of a DMSJ cavity flameholder, characterizing its turbulent aerodynamics at conditions representative of operational design points as well as departures from them. An examination of replicated inlet-generated distortion found that the extent of recirculating flow in the cavity, which governs entrainment and residence time of fuel and air, was strongly dependent on the impingement location of an oblique shock wave. Impingement upstream of the cavity diminished the size of the recirculation region, whereas impingement directly on the cavity increased it. The aerodynamics of fuel injection upstream of the cavity were replicated with wall-normal sonic air injection, which thickened the shear layer separating cavity recirculation from main-duct flow and reduced spatial variation of fluctuating velocity magnitudes.

Past measurements have been challenged by the tendency of conventional metal oxide velocimetry tracers to inhibit their own imaging by adhering to flowpath windows. To resolve this limitation, the novel application of graphite flakes as PIV tracers in a high-speed flow was shown to provide acceptable flow tracking while maintaining compatibility with flowpath windows and persistence through the reaction zone. Subsequent measurements examined flameholder operation with premixed hydrocarbon fueling at both steady-state conditions as well as during the lean-blowout transient. Air injection downstream of the combustor was used to maintain the pre-combustion shock system independent of the amount of heat release.

It was found that mean velocity in the spanwise center plane of the cavity flameholder was governed primarily by the length of the shock system, whereas turbulent fluctuations were most strongly influenced by whether or not combustion was present, indicating turbulent aerodynamics of dual-mode operation cannot be replicated by artificial blockage. Comparison of PIV results with corresponding measurements of the OH and \ce{CH^*} radicals demonstrated how main-duct combustion is dependent on turbulent exchange with the cavity, and three-component PIV measurements at the boundary of the cavity and main duct indicated that the flow is largely spanwise-uniform at this interface. Turbulence intensity at the combustor entrance was found to be positively correlated with prior measurements of flame front angle, demonstrating how turbulent fluctuations drive flame spreading rate in the premixed regime. Integral length scales at this location were found to be constant with a change in fueling rate from one operational limit to the other, providing further evidence that turbulent aerodynamics are dependent on the presence of heat release and not its magnitude.

Examination of the lean blowout transient with kHz-rate PIV found that changes in cavity aerodynamics were confined to a period prior to blowout two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the collapse of the pre-combustion shock system, suggesting the cessation of flameholding was due to the cavity mixture falling below flammability limits, rather than an alteration of the turbulent exchange between the cavity and the remainder of the combustor. This result suggests current flight-proven velocimetry techniques could be used in a flight vehicle to predict imminent blowout and enable operation near the lean limit.},

For this purpose, a new tomographic reconstruction technique based on telecentric imaging in combination with the epipolar geometry is presented. The method overcomes the need for memory intensive weighting matrices or cost intensive iterations, which are necessary in iterative algebraic reconstruction techniques. A characteristic of tomographic reconstruction is the reconstruction of ghost particles. As the aim of PTV is the reconstruction of true particle paths, this article focuses on the removal of ghost particles and ghost trajectories. The method is validated via a synthetic turbulent flow field and via the benchmark experiment of a vortex ring.},

  abstract  = {The statistics of the velocity gradient tensor \$\textbackslashunicode[STIX]\{x1D63C\}=\textbackslashboldsymbol\{\{\textbackslashrm\textbackslashnabla\}\}\textbackslashboldsymbol\{u\}\$, which embody the fine scales of turbulence, are influenced by turbulent ‘structure’. Whilst velocity gradient statistics and dynamics have been well characterised, the connection between structure and dynamics has largely focused on rotation-dominated flow and relied upon data from numerical simulation alone. Using numerical and spatially resolved experimental datasets of homogeneous turbulence, the role of structure is examined for all local (incompressible) flow topologies characterisable by \$\textbackslashunicode[STIX]\{x1D63C\}\$. Structures are studied through the footprints they leave in conditional averages of the \$Q=-\textbackslashtext\{Tr\}(\textbackslashunicode[STIX]\{x1D63C\}\textasciicircum\{2\})/2\$ field, pertinent to non-local strain production, obtained using two complementary conditional averaging techniques. The first, stochastic estimation, approximates the \$Q\$ field conditioned upon \$\textbackslashunicode[STIX]\{x1D63C\}\$ and educes quantitatively similar structure in both datasets, dissimilar to that of random Gaussian velocity fields. Moreover, it strongly resembles a promising model for velocity gradient dynamics recently proposed by Wilczek \&amp; Meneveau (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 756, 2014, pp. 191–225), but is derived under a less restrictive premise, with explicitly determined closure coefficients. The second technique examines true conditional averages of the \$Q\$ field, which is used to validate the stochastic estimation and provide insights towards the model’s refinement. Jointly, these approaches confirm that vortex tubes are the predominant feature of rotation-dominated regions and additionally show that shear layer structures are active in strain-dominated regions. In both cases, kinematic features of these structures explain alignment statistics of the pressure Hessian eigenvectors and why local and non-local strain production act in opposition to each other.},

Interrogation windows subjected to strong in-plane displacement gradients often produce correlation maps presenting multiple peaks. Standard multi-grid procedures discard such ambiguous correlation windows using a signal to noise (SNR) filter. The proposed algorithm improves the standard multi-grid algorithm allowing the detection of splintered peaks in a correlation map through an automatic threshold, producing multiple displacement vectors for each correlation area. Vector locations are chosen by translating images according to the peak displacements and by selecting the areas with the strongest match. The method is assessed on synthetic images of a boundary layer of varying intensity and a sinusoidal displacement field of changing wavelength. An experimental case of a flow exhibiting strong velocity gradients is also provided to show the improvements brought by this technique.},

  abstract = {The fine-scale structure in turbulence is investigated by quad-plane stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (QPSPIV). The quad-plane consists of two each of different polarizations and wavelengths, and it provides three velocity components at four independent parallel planes. Measurements have been undertaken in the developed region of a turbulent round jet with a spatial resolution sufficient to capture the small-scale structures. The advantage of the QPSPIV is presented in terms of the spectral response in the evaluation of the out-of-plane velocity gradient. The full velocity gradient tensor is computed with a fourth-order finite difference scheme in the out-of-plane direction as well as the in-plane directions.

These values agree well with the data in the literature. The phase-averaged distributions of turbulence quantities around the coherent fine-scale eddy indicate an apparent elliptic feature around the axis. Furthermore, the state of the strain rate exerting the eddy is quantified from the phase-averaged distributions of eigenvalues of the strain rate tensor and the alignment of the corresponding eigenvectors against the axis. The present study gives a solid experimental support of the coherent fine-scale structures in turbulence, and the technique can be applied to various flow fields and to the higher Reynolds number condition.},

  abstract = {In this manuscript, we investigate the statistical convergence of turbulent flow statistics from finite-record-length time-series measurements. Analytical solutions of the convergence rate of the mean, variance, and autocorrelation function as a function of record length are presented based on using mean-squared error analysis and the consideration of turbulent flows as random processes. Experimental assessment of the statistical convergence theory is presented using 20-kHz laser Rayleigh scattering measurements of a conserved scalar ($\xi$) in a turbulent free jet. Excellent agreement between experiments and theory is noted, providing validation of the statistical convergence analysis. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported assessment and verification of statistical convergence theory as applied to turbulent flows. The verified theory provides a practitioner a method for a priori determining the necessary temporal record length for a desired statistical accuracy or conversely, accurately estimating the uncertainty of a measurement for a given temporal record length. Furthermore, we propose a new hybrid ``multi-burst'' data processing scheme based on combined independent ensemble and time-series statistics targeted for shorter-duration time-series measurements. The new methodology is based on taking the ensemble mean of derived statistical moments from many individual finite-duration time-series measurements. This approach is used to systematically converge toward the ``expected'' value of any statistical moment at a rate of                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sqrt M{\$}{\$}                                                                                    M                                                                            , where M is the number of individual time-series measurements. The proposed multi-burst methodology is assessed experimentally, and excellent agreement between measurements and theory is observed. A key outcome of the implementation of the multi-burst processing method is noted in the estimation of the autocorrelation function. Specifically, an unbiased estimator of the autocorrelation function can be used with much less uncertainty as compared to the biased estimator, which is not the case for single time-series measurements irrespective of record length. The primary outcome of the multi-burst processing scheme is a methodology for achieving high statistical convergence for turbulent flow time-series measurements characterized by limited acquisition time, whether facility or instrument dependent.},

The bubble size information is estimated from the bubble scattered peak intensity. Both quantities correlate following a power law, as predicted by the Mie scattering theory. The technique is applied to the study of the dynamics of sub-millimeter air bubbles in a three-dimensional vortical flow generated by a propeller.

  abstract   = {Scramjet propulsion devices have the potential for revolutionizing high-speed atmospheric flight in the future. This includes aerospace planes for space access and high-speed long distance strike vehicles for national defense. Despite over 60 years of research, the high-speed, turbulent, combusting flow field of the engine is not fully understood. In particular, the dual-mode scramjet (DMSJ) is complicated by the ability to operate in different modes of combustion. These modes of combustion are referred to as the ramjet mode of operation, characterized by subsonic combustor inflow, and the scramjet mode of operation, characterized by supersonic combustor inflow. The gap in knowledge stems from the inability to experimentally measure pertinent flow properties and the resulting absence of accurate computational tools. Renewed interest in hypersonic flight and the advancement of laser-based optical measurement techniques provide an opportunity to quantify flow properties that were once not accessible. This includes instream Velocimetry in the supersonic, turbulent, combusting flow field of a DMSJ. Such measurements can provide a fundamental understanding of the convective transport processes in these engines. Of particular interest is how these processes change for the DMSJ when operating in the supersonic, subsonic, and mixed modes of combustion.

This work employs the experimental technique of Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (SPIV) to measure the 3-dimensional, instantaneous velocity within a DMSJ model. This work is part of the greater collaborative efforts of the National Center for Hypersonic Combined Cycle Propulsion (NCHCCP). Significant design of new DMSJ model hardware was necessary to allow the extensive experimental testing with the end goal of building a one-of-a-kind data set for the development and validation of advanced modeling techniques.

The work presented herein contributes to this goal by measuring the flow field within the combustor section in both the ramjet mode and scramjet mode of operation at four axial locations. These measurements represent the first reported SPIV measurements in the two different modes of operation of a DMSJ and reveal the key similarities and differences between the modes. The influence on the velocity field as the combustion process develops axially is also identified for each mode. Additionally, the measurements serve to quantify the velocity bias associated with the single-stream seeding method. The primary properties presented in the current study are mean velocity magnitude, cross-plane velocity vectors, vorticity, and turbulent kinetic energy. The defining flow features of the scramjet mode of operation are a low-momentum separation region near the fuel injection wall surrounded by a high-speed freestream. Alternatively, the ramjet mode of operation consists of a high-speed fuel jet core surrounded by a low-speed freestream. This data helps to identify the location, size, and intensity of the classic ramp fuel injector induced vortices which act to mix the fuel and air. The results indicate that the vortices expand with the axial location in the flowpath while the intensity decreases. In addition, the peak levels of turbulent kinetic energy have been identified ranging between 10,000-15,000 m2/s2 and are located corresponding to a shear layer present in the axial velocity component. The comprehensive data set provides converged turbulence statistics and the means to quantitatively compare experiments to numerical models. Comparisons with a hybrid LES/RANS computational model (conducted at N.C. State) reveal some areas of improvement to the computational model but overall excellent agreement was observed.},

The discussion shows how the correlation signal benefits from simple operations such as the window-offset technique, or the continuous window deformation, which compensates for the in-plane velocity gradient. The image interrogation process is presented within the discussion of the image matching problem and several algorithms and implementations currently in use are classified depending on the choice made about the particle image pattern matching scheme. Several methods that differ in their implementations are found to be substantially similar. Iterative image deformation methods that account for the continuous particle image pattern transformation are analysed and the effect of crucial choices such as image interpolation method, displacement prediction correction and correlation peak fit scheme are discussed. The quantitative performance assessment made through synthetic PIV images yields order-of-magnitude improvement on the precision of the particle image displacement at a sub-pixel level when the image deformation is applied. Moreover, the issue of spatial resolution is addressed and the limiting factors of the specific interrogation methods are discussed. Finally, an attempt for a flow-adaptive spatial resolution method is proposed. The method takes into account the local velocity derivatives in order to perform a local increase of the interrogation spatial density and a refinement of the local interrogation window size. The resulting spatial resolution is selectively enhanced. The method's performance is analysed and compared with some precursor techniques, namely the conventional cross-correlation analysis with and without the effect of a window discrete offset and deformation. The suitability of the method for the measurement in turbulent flows is illustrated with the application to a turbulent backward facing step flow.},

  abstract   = {A survey is given of the major developments in three-dimensional velocity field measurements using the tomographic particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. The appearance of tomo-PIV dates back seven years from the present review (Elsinga et al 2005a 6th Int. Symp. PIV (Pasadena, CA) ) and this approach has rapidly spread as a versatile, robust and accurate technique to investigate three-dimensional flows (Arroyo and Hinsch 2008 Topics in Applied Physics vol 112 ed A Schröder and C E Willert (Berlin: Springer) pp 127–54) and turbulence physics in particular. A considerable number of applications have been achieved over a wide range of flow problems, which requires the current status and capabilities of tomographic PIV to be reviewed. The fundamental aspects of the technique are discussed beginning from hardware considerations for volume illumination, imaging systems, their configurations and system calibration. The data processing aspects are of uppermost importance: image pre-processing, 3D object reconstruction and particle motion analysis are presented with their fundamental aspects along with the most advanced approaches. Reconstruction and cross-correlation algorithms, attaining higher measurement precision, spatial resolution or higher computational efficiency, are also discussed. The exploitation of 3D and time-resolved (4D) tomographic PIV data includes the evaluation of flow field pressure on the basis of the flow governing equation. The discussion also covers a - posteriori error analysis techniques. The most relevant applications of tomo-PIV in fluid mechanics are surveyed, covering experiments in air and water flows. In measurements in flow regimes from low-speed to supersonic, most emphasis is given to the complex 3D organization of turbulent coherent structures.},

  abstract = {The flow-tracing fidelity of sub-millimetre diameter helium-filled soap bubbles (HFSB) for low-speed aerodynamics is studied. The main interest of using HFSB in relation to micron-size droplets is the large amount of scattered light, enabling larger-scale three-dimensional experiments by tomographic PIV. The assessment of aerodynamic behaviour closely follows the method proposed in the early work of Kerho and Bragg (Exp Fluids 50:929--948, 1994) who evaluated the tracer trajectories around the stagnation region at the leading edge of an airfoil. The conclusions of the latter investigation differ from the present work, which concludes sub-millimetre HFSB do represent a valid alternative for quantitative velocimetry in wind tunnel aerodynamic experiments. The flow stagnating ahead of a circular cylinder of 25 mm diameter is considered at speeds up to 30 m/s. The tracers are injected in the free-stream and high-speed PIV, and PTV are used to obtain the velocity field distribution. A qualitative assessment based on streamlines is followed by acceleration and slip velocity measurements using PIV experiments with fog droplets as a term of reference. The tracing fidelity is controlled by the flow rates of helium, liquid soap and air in HFSB production. A characteristic time response, defined as the ratio of slip velocity and the fluid acceleration, is obtained. The feasibility of performing time-resolved tomographic PIV measurements over large volumes in aerodynamic wind tunnels is also studied. The flow past a 5-cm-diameter cylinder is measured over a volume of 20 {\texttimes} 20 {\texttimes} 12 cm3 at a rate of 2 kHz. The achieved seeding density of <0.01 ppp enables resolving the K{\'a}rm{\'a}n vortices, whereas turbulent sub-structures cannot be captured.},

The findings show that the holographic PIV method is useful to measure flow patterns in larger volumes whereas the tomographic PIV should be used to resolve three-dimensional small-scale structures.},

  abstract = {A Lagrangian tracking method is introduced, which uses a prediction of the particle distribution for the subsequent time-step as a mean to seize the temporal domain. Errors introduced by the prediction process are corrected by an image matching technique (`shaking' the particle in space), followed by an iterative triangulation of particles newly entering the measurement domain. The scheme was termed `Shake-The-Box' and previously characterized as `4D-PTV' due to the strong interaction with the temporal dimension. Trajectories of tracer particles are identified at high spatial accuracy due to a nearly complete suppression of ghost particles; a temporal filtering scheme further improves on accuracy and allows for the extraction of local velocity and acceleration as derivatives of a continuous function. Exploiting the temporal information enables the processing of densely seeded flows (beyond 0.1 particles per pixel, ppp), which were previously reserved for tomographic PIV evaluations. While TOMO-PIV uses statistical means to evaluate the flow (building an `anonymous' voxel space with subsequent spatial averaging of the velocity information using correlation), the Shake-The-Box approach is able to identify and track individual particles at numbers of tens or even hundreds of thousands per time-step. The method is outlined in detail, followed by descriptions of applications to synthetic and experimental data. The synthetic data evaluation reveals that STB is able to capture virtually all true particles, while effectively suppressing the formation of ghost particles. For the examined four-camera set-up particle image densities N                        I up to 0.125 ppp could be processed. For noise-free images, the attained accuracy is very high. The addition of synthetic noise reduces usable particle image density (N                        I ≤ 0.075 ppp for highly noisy images) and accuracy (still being significantly higher compared to tomographic reconstruction). The solutions remain virtually free of ghost particles. Processing an experimental data set on a transitional jet in water demonstrates the benefits of advanced Lagrangian evaluation in describing flow details---both on small scales (by the individual tracks) and on larger structures (using an interpolation onto an Eulerian grid). Comparisons to standard TOMO-PIV processing for synthetic and experimental evaluations show distinct benefits in local accuracy, completeness of the solution, ghost particle occurrence, spatial resolution, temporal coherence and computational effort.},

  abstract   = {This paper discusses the propagation of the instantaneous uncertainty of PIV measurements to statistical and instantaneous quantities of interest derived from the velocity field. The expression of the uncertainty of vorticity, velocity divergence, mean value and Reynolds stresses is derived. It is shown that the uncertainty of vorticity and velocity divergence requires the knowledge of the spatial correlation between the error of the x and y particle image displacement, which depends upon the measurement spatial resolution. The uncertainty of statistical quantities is often dominated by the random uncertainty due to the finite sample size and decreases with the square root of the effective number of independent samples. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to assess the accuracy of the uncertainty propagation formulae. Furthermore, three experimental assessments are carried out. In the first experiment, a turntable is used to simulate a rigid rotation flow field. The estimated uncertainty of the vorticity is compared with the actual vorticity error root-mean-square, with differences between the two quantities within 5–10% for different interrogation window sizes and overlap factors. A turbulent jet flow is investigated in the second experimental assessment. The reference velocity, which is used to compute the reference value of the instantaneous flow properties of interest, is obtained with an auxiliary PIV system, which features a higher dynamic range than the measurement system. Finally, the uncertainty quantification of statistical quantities is assessed via PIV measurements in a cavity flow. The comparison between estimated uncertainty and actual error demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed uncertainty propagation methodology.},

Results are presented for camera position and orientation in three-dimensional space, to obtain an optimal reconstruction quality. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis is performed on the accuracy of first and second order flow statistics, at various voxel sizes normalised using the viscous inner length scale. This enables the result to be used as a general reference for wall-bounded turbulent experiments. In addition, a ratio relating seeding density and the interrogation volume size is proposed to obtain an optimal reference value that remains constant. This can be used to determine the required seeding density concentration for a certain interrogation volume size.},

Relevant uncertainty concerns are related to the effect of the thermophoretic force, acting on a seeding particle while crossing the flame front, and to the non-homogeneity and time-dependence of the refractive index field. The uncertainty due to thermophoresis is assessed by numerically studying the motion of a particle crossing a reference temperature profile. The effect of the refractive index variation is evaluated by means of theoretical analysis of light propagation and image formation, supported by experimental tests designed for this special purpose.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous \{CH\} and \{OH\} planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurement have been developed to investigate the local flame structure of turbulent premixed flames. In this system, high-speed \{CMOS\} cameras were adopted to capture clear stereoscopic particle images without contamination by the flame radiation. The effects of scattering of \{CH\} \{PLIF\} laser by tracer particles are carefully investigated to improve signal-to-noise ratio in \{CH\} fluorescence images. The developed simultaneous two radical concentrations and three-component velocity measurement on a two-dimensional plane was applied to relatively high Reynolds number turbulent premixed flames in a swirl-stabilized combustor. All measurements were conducted for methane–air premixed flames in the corrugated flamelet regime. Simultaneous \{CH\} and \{OH\} images suggest the presence of the isolated burned gas in the unburned mixture and the isolated unburned mixture in the burned side, which have been predicted by direct numerical simulations. Detailed analysis of simultaneous \{CH\} and \{OH\} images reveals that the minimum curvature radius of the flame front coincides with the Kolmogorov scale. Strong three-dimensional velocity fluctuations, which are measured by the stereoscopic PIV, imply that misunderstanding of the flame/turbulence interactions would be caused by the analysis of two-component velocity distributions in a cross-section. Furthermore, comparisons of CH–OH \{PLIF\} and three-component velocity fields show that the burned gases do not always have high-speed velocity in a relatively high Reynolds number turbulent premixed flame. The Reynolds number dependence of the flame front was clearly captured by the simultaneous CH–OH \{PLIF\} and stereoscopic \{PIV\} measurements. },

  abstract = {Measurements of instantaneous volumetric flow fields are required for an improved understanding of turbulent flames. In non-reacting flows, tomographic particle image velocimetry (TPIV) is an established method for three-dimensional (3D) flow measurements. In flames, the reconstruction of the particles location becomes challenging due to a locally varying index of refraction causing beam-steering. This work presents TPIV measurements within a turbulent lifted non-premixed methane jet flame. Solid seeding particles were used to provide the 3D flow field in the vicinity of the flame base, including unburned and burned regions. Four cameras were arranged in a horizontal plane around the jet flame. Following an iterative volumetric self-calibration procedure, the remaining disparity caused by the flame was less than 0.2 pixels. Comparisons with conventional two-component PIV in terms of mean and rms values provided additional confidence in the TPIV measurements.},

  abstract = {A stereo-PIV (stereo particle image velocimetry) calibration procedure has been developed based on fitting a camera pinhole model to the two cameras using single or multiple views of a 3D calibration plate. A disparity vector map is computed on the real particle images by cross-correlation of the images from cameras 1 and 2 to determine if the calibration plate coincides with the light sheet. From the disparity vectors, the true position of the light sheet in space is fitted and the mapping functions are corrected accordingly. It is shown that it is possible to derive accurate mapping functions, even if the calibration plate is quite far away from the light sheet, making the calibration procedure much easier. A modified 3-media camera pinhole model has been implemented to account for index-of-refraction changes along the optical path. It is then possible to calibrate outside closed flow cells and self-calibrate onto the recordings. This method allows stereo-PIV measurements to be taken inside closed measurement volumes, which was not previously possible. From the computed correlation maps, the position and thickness of the two laser light sheets can be derived to determine the thickness, degree of overlap and the flatness of the two sheets.},

  abstract = {Planar self-calibration methods have become standard for stereo PIV to correct misalignments between laser light sheet and calibration plane. Computing cross-correlation between images from camera 1 and 2 taken at the same time, non-zero disparity vectors indicate rotational and translational misalignments relative to the coordinate system defined by a calibration plate. This approach works well for thin light sheets but fails for extended volumes recorded in 3D-PTV or tomographic PIV experiments. Here it is primarily necessary to correct calibration errors leading to triangulation errors in 3D-PTV or in degraded tomographic volume reconstruction. Tomographic PIV requires calibration accuracies of a fraction of a pixel throughout the complete volume, which is difficult to achieve experimentally. A new volumetric self-calibration technique has been developed based on the computation of the 3D position of matching particles by triangulation as in 3D-PTV. The residual triangulation error (`disparity') is then used to correct the mapping functions for all cameras. A statistical clustering method suitable for dense particle images has been implemented to find correct disparity map peaks from true particle matches. Disparity maps from multiple recordings are summed for better statistics. This self-calibration scheme has been validated using several tomographic PIV experiments improving the vector quality significantly. The relevance for other 3D velocimetry methods is discussed.},

First the second image is dewarped back onto the first one using the computed displacement field which provides two almost perfectly matching images. Differences are analyzed regarding the effect of shifting the peak of the correlation function. A relationship is derived between the standard deviation of intensity differences in each interrogation window and the expected asymmetry of the correlation peak, which is then converted to the uncertainty of a displacement vector. This procedure is tested with synthetic data for various types of noise and experimental conditions (pixel noise, out-of-plane motion, seeding density, particle image size, etc) and is shown to provide an accurate estimate of the true error.},

Their extensive study focuses on the mean structure of the velocity gradient and the pressure Hessian fields for various small-scale flow topologies.

  abstract = {The feasibility of using high-power light-emitting diodes (LED) as a light source for high frame rate schlieren imaging is investigated. Continuous sequences of high-intensity light pulses are achieved by overdriving the LED with current pulses up to a factor of ten beyond its specifications. In comparison to commonly used pulsed light sources such as gas discharge lamps and pulsed lasers, the pulsed LED has several attractive advantages: the pulse-to-pulse intensity variation is on the same order of magnitude as the detector (camera) noise permitting quantitative intensity measurements. The LED's narrow emission bandwidth reduces chromatic abberations, yet it is spectrally wide enough to prevent the appearance of speckle and diffraction effects in the images. Most importantly, the essentially lag-free light emission within tens of nanoseconds of the applied current pulse allows the LED to be operated at varying frequencies (i.e., asynchronously), which generally is not possible with neither lasers nor discharge lamps. The pulsed LED source, driven by a simple driver circuit, is demonstrated on two schlieren imaging setups. The first configuration visualizes the temporal evolution of shock structures and sound waves of an under-expanded jet that is impinging on a rigid surface at frame rates of 500 kHz to 1 MHz. In a second application, long sequences of several thousand high-resolution images are acquired on a free jet at a frame rate of 1 kHz. The low-intensity fluctuation and large sample number allow a reliable computation of two-point correlation data from the image sequences.},

The effect of noise and spatial resolution was quantified by examining the local and global errors in the velocity, vorticity and dissipation fields in addition to other properties of interest such as the flow divergence, topological invariants and energy spectra. In order to accurately capture the instantaneous gradient fields and calculate sensitive quantities such as the dissipation rate, a minimum resolution of x/$\eta$ = 3 is required, with smoothing recommended for the TPIV results to control the inherently higher noise levels. Comparing these results with experimental data showed that while the attenuation of velocity and gradient quantities was predicted well, higher noise levels in the experimental data led increased divergence.},

A nonlinear phase contribution was estimated, allowing for the measurement of strong phase objects.

In addition, modification of the Lopez cutoff filter is proposed, demonstrating its superiority over the piecewise linear and the Gaussian step convolution filters. Simulations of coherent schlieren imaging as well as phase derivative measurements were performed. Finally, the imaging properties of the schlieren systems with the different filters are compared.},

The primary diagnostics used were combined planar laser-induced fluorescence of the OH radical and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) with simultaneous repetition rates of 10 kHz and a measurement duration of 0.8 s. Also measured were acoustic pulsations and OH chemiluminescence. Analysis revealed strong local periodicity in the thermoacoustically self-excited (or ‘noisy’) flame (ϕ = 0.73) in the regions of the flow corresponding to the inner shear layer and the jet-inflow. This periodicity appears to be the result of a helical precessing vortex core (PVC) present in that region of the combustor. The PVC has a precession frequency double (at 570 Hz) that of the thermo-acoustic pulsation (at 288 Hz). A comparison of the various data sets and analysis techniques applied to each flame suggests a strong coupling between the PVC and the thermo-acoustic pulsation in the noisy flame. Measurements of the stable (‘quiet’) flame (ϕ = 0.83) revealed a global fluctuation in both velocity and heat-release around 364 Hz, but no clear evidence of a PVC.},

In this study, the flow field of the reacting jet was investigated using high repetition rate (HRR) (5 kHz), two-component particle imaging velocimetry and OH-PLIF. In applications similar to the one currently studied in this work, viz. secondary injection of fuel in a gas turbine combustor, rapid mixing and chemical reaction in the near field of jet injection are desirable. Based on our analysis, it is hypothesized that the shear layer and wake field vortices play a significant role in stabilizing a steady reaction front within the near wake region of the jet. Premixed jets composed of natural gas and air were injected through an extended nozzle into the vitiated flow downstream of a low-swirl burner that produced the vitiated, swirled flow. The jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio was varied to study the corresponding effect on the flow field. The time-averaged flow field shows a steady wake vortex very similar to that seen in the wake of a cylindrical bluff body which helps to stabilize the reaction zone within the wake of the jet. The HRR data acquisition also provided temporally resolved information on the transient structure of the wake flow associated with the reacting jet in crossflow.},

  abstract = { The development and applications of a new class of water-soluble compounds suitable for molecular tagging diagnostics are described. These molecular complexes are formed by mixing a lumophore, an appropriate alcohol, and cyclodextrin. Using 1-BrNp as the lumophore, cyclohexanol is determined to be the most effective overall among the alcohols for which data are currently available. Information is provided for the design of experiments based on these complexes along with a less complex method for generating the grid patterns typically used for velocimetry. Implementation of a two-detector system is described which, in combination with a spatial correlation technique for determining velocities, relaxes the requirement that the initial tagging pattern be known a priori, eliminates errors in velocity estimates caused by variations in the grid pattern during an experiment, and makes it possible to study flows with non-uniform mixtures. This detection and analysis combination also solves one of the problems associated with using caged fluorescein to study high-speed flows. In addition to the traditional implementation for velocimetry, novel applications for studying the Lagrangian evolution of both reacting and non-reacting interfaces and obtaining combined passive scalar/velocity measurements are demonstrated.},

Such variations can be observed, e.g., in flows with components perpendicular to the illumination sheet, leading to out-of-plane displacements of the tracer particles. The achievable accuracy of PIV measurements is shown to be limited by this effect alone to be of the order of 0.1 pixel, yielding a basic limitation of the PIV technique.},
